# This tutorial aims to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the FactoMineR and factoextra packages.

What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Why Use It?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much relevant information as possible. It transforms the original variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, which capture the most significant patterns in the data.

Why Use PCA?
Dimensionality Reduction : In datasets with many variables, PCA helps simplify the structure while minimizing information loss.
Visualization : PCA allows us to project high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D space, making it easier to interpret and analyze.
Feature Selection : By identifying the most important components, PCA helps focus on key variables while reducing redundancy.
Noise Reduction : It can filter out irrelevant variations in the data, leading to improved performance in machine learning models.
